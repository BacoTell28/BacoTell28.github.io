I am a second year (sophomore) at Virginia Tech studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with concentrations in both machine learning and wireless communication and signal processing. I am an undergraduate researcher in the College of Engineering inside the department of Engineering Education where I study the differences between different LLM's abilities to extract certain information given a certain document (such as a resume or syllabus). My interests include neural networks, signal processing for wireless systems, and applied machine learning for information extraction and analysis.
